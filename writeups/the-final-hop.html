  <h2>📌 Challenge Description</h2>
  <p>
    On the night of May 21, the SOC received a high-severity alert indicating
    unusual lateral movement in the Active Directory environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Internal logs showed that the Domain Controller (DC) was accessed by a
    suspicious account. A few hours later, a critical application server
    became inaccessible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Booting from a recovery image revealed that the local Administrator
    password had been changed without authorization.
  </p>

  <p>
    The objective was to investigate the incident, reconstruct the attacker’s
    actions, and recover the changed password.
